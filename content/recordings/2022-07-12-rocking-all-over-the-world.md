# Rocking All Over The World

*Status: Mixing*

The first recording we did. And not everything went good.  
But we got some insights for the next times.

## Retrospective

- The Video Setup needs to be made better
  - it was not clear how to record
  - The Frame Rate is to low
- Reverb for the vocals during recording
- Access to the Mixer did not work as the app assumed to be offline
- The DI were not working
- Having the meetup information in two languages is some effort

## Song/Ideas for the next round

- [**Live - Lightning Crashes**][llc]
- [Foo Fighters - Times Like These][fftlt]
